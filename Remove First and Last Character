/*
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.
*/


function removeChar(str){
 return str.slice(1,-1);
};


// another solution

function removeChar(str){
 let result='';
 for(let i=1;i<str.length-1;i++)
    result+=str[i];
  return result;
};
